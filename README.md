# Landing Page Project

## Description

This project contains HTML, CSS, and Javascript for an example landing page. The navigation bar is built dynamically based on the sections within the page. Each link included in the navigation bar smoothly scrolls the page to the appropriate section when clicked. Any page section that is contained within the viewport is highlighted as active.
